		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an IT Major at University of Central Florida. I've been doing SEO work for the past year and a half now. 
		I have a 3.48 GPA and I do particularly well in programming classes. Beyond programming and coding I enjoy graphic design, web design,
		game design, computer building, and pretty much anything else related to computers. I also enjoy keeping up with current events, and having
		good times with friends and family.
